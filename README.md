# AstraRAG---Agentic-RAG-Chatbot-
AstraRAG is an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based AI chatbot designed to provide accurate, context-aware, and reliable answers by combining large language models with intelligent information retrieval .

Unlike traditional chatbots that rely only on pre-trained knowledge, AstraRAG dynamically retrieves relevant information from external knowledge sources (documents, PDFs, databases, or web content) and uses AI agents to reason, plan, and decide how to answer user queries efficiently.
Key Features

Agentic Architecture
Uses intelligent agents that can:

Decide whether retrieval is needed

Choose the best data source

Break complex questions into sub-tasks

Verify and refine responses

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Embeddings are created from documents using vector databases

Relevant chunks are retrieved based on user queries

Responses are generated using both retrieved context and LLM reasoning

High Accuracy & Reduced Hallucination
Since answers are grounded in retrieved data, AstraRAG minimizes incorrect or fabricated responses.

Multi-Source Knowledge Support
Supports PDFs, text files, databases, APIs, and web data.

Conversational Memory
